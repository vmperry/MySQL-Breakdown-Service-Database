Description
This project involves creating and managing a MySQL database for a breakdown company. The database is designed to handle member registrations, vehicle ownership, and breakdown incidents efficiently. It integrates member, vehicle, and engineer data to ensure high organization, accuracy, and accessibility, which is crucial for delivering exceptional service and maintaining a competitive edge.

Objectives
- Systematically manage and organize data for a breakdown company.
- Link multiple vehicles to their respective members.
- Efficiently manage service requests and maintenance histories.
- Streamline the assignment and tracking of breakdown incidents.
- Provide timely assistance and analyze breakdown patterns to optimize resource allocation.

Tasks
Task 1: Create TablesCreate the following tables with the specified columns:
Member Table- Member_ID (Primary Key): int
- First_Name: varchar(20)
- Last_Name: varchar(20)
- Member_Location: varchar(20)
- Member_Age: int
Vehicle Table- Vehicle_Registration (Primary Key): varchar(10)
- Vehicle_Make: varchar(10)
- Vehicle_Model: varchar(10)
- Member_ID (Foreign Key): int
Engineer Table- Engineer_ID (Primary Key): int
- First_Name: varchar(20)
- Last_Name: varchar(20)
Breakdown Table- Breakdown_ID (Primary Key): int
- Vehicle_Registration (Foreign Key): varchar(10)
- Engineer_ID (Foreign Key): int
- Breakdown_Date: date
- Breakdown_Time: time
- Breakdown_Location: varchar(20)
- Using the ALTER command, set the foreign keys.

Task 2: Insert DataInsert the following data into the tables:
Member Table- 5 records
Vehicle Table- 8 records
Engineer Table- 3 records
Breakdown Table- 12 records
